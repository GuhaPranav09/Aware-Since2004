# Firebase dynamic links

1. Make your client setup has [`google-services.json`](./INSTALLATION.md#android) and [`GoogleService-Info.plist`](./INSTALLATION.md#ios) config files pointing to a real Firebase project.
2. Make sure `DEEP_LINK_` variables are properly setup for both [`functions/.env`](./INSTALLATION.md#environment) and [`client/.env`](./INSTALLATION.md#environment-1)
3. Start functions with a real firebase project:
   ```
   yarn start:remote --project <firebase-project>
   ```
